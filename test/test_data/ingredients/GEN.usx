  <para style="ip">The name <char style="bk">Genesis</char> means “origin.” The book tells about the creation of the universe, the origin of human beings, the beginning of sin and suffering in the world, and about God's way of dealing with people. Genesis can be divided into two main parts:</para>
  <para style="ip">1) <char style="it">Chapters 1—11</char> The creation of the world and the early history of the human race. Here are the accounts of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, and the Tower of Babylon.</para>
  <para style="ip">2) <char style="it">Chapters 12—50</char> The history of the early ancestors of the Israelites. The first is Abraham, who was notable for his faith and his obedience to God. Then follow the stories of his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob (also called Israel), and of Jacob's twelve sons, the founders of the twelve tribes of Israel. Special attention is given to one of the sons, Joseph, and the events that brought Jacob and his other sons with their families to live in Egypt.</para>
  <para style="ip">While this book tells stories about people, it is first and foremost an account of what God has done. It begins with the affirmation that God created the universe, and it ends with a promise that God will continue to show his concern for his people. Throughout the book the main character is God, who judges and punishes those who do wrong, leads and helps his people, and shapes their history. This ancient book was written to record the story of a people's faith and to help keep that faith alive.</para>

    <verse number="29" style="v" />Jacob answered, “You know how I have worked for you and how your flocks have prospered under my care. <verse number="30" style="v" />The little you had before I came has grown enormously, and the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has blessed you wherever I went. <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">30.30: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">wherever I went; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">because of me.</char></note> Now it is time for me to look out for my own interests.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />“What shall I pay you?” Laban asked.</para>
  <para style="p">Jacob answered, “I don't want any wages.

That is all the wages I want. <verse number="33" style="v" />In the future you can easily find out if I have been honest. When you come to check up on my wages, if I have any goat that isn't speckled or spotted or any sheep that isn't black, you will know that it has been stolen.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="34" style="v" />Laban answered, “Agreed. We will do as you suggest.” <verse number="35" style="v" />But that day Laban removed the male goats that had stripes or spots and all the females that were speckled and spotted or which had white on them; he also removed all the black sheep. He put his sons in charge of them, <verse number="36" style="v" />and then went away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days. Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flocks.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="37" style="v" />Jacob got green branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them. <verse number="38" style="v" />He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs. He put them there, because the animals mated when they came to drink. <verse number="39" style="v" />So when the goats bred in front of the branches, they produced young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="40" style="v" />Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Laban's flock. In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Laban's.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="41" style="v" />When the healthy animals were mating, Jacob put the branches in front of them at the drinking troughs, so that they would breed among the branches. <verse number="42" style="v" />But he did not put the branches in front of the weak animals. Soon Laban had all the weak animals, and Jacob all the healthy ones. <verse number="43" style="v" />In this way Jacob became very wealthy. He had many flocks, slaves, camels, and donkeys.</para>
  <chapter number="31" style="c" />

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where his flocks were. <verse number="5" style="v" />He said to them, “I have noticed that your father is not as friendly toward me as he used to be; but my father's God has been with me. <verse number="6" style="v" />You both know that I have worked for your father with all my strength. <verse number="7" style="v" />Yet he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Rachel and Leah answered Jacob, “There is nothing left for us to inherit from our father. <verse number="15" style="v" />He treats us like foreigners.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17-18" style="v" />So Jacob got ready to go back to his father in the land of Canaan. He put his children and his wives on the camels, and drove all his flocks ahead of him, with everything that he had gotten in Mesopotamia. <verse number="19" style="v" />Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and during his absence Rachel stole the household gods that belonged to her father. <verse number="20" style="v" />Jacob deceived Laban by not letting him know that he was leaving. <verse number="21" style="v" />He took everything he owned and left in a hurry.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />Laban said to Jacob, “Why did you deceive me and carry off my daughters like women captured in war? <verse number="27" style="v" />Why did you deceive me and slip away without telling me? If you had told me, I would have sent you on your way with rejoicing and singing to the music of tambourines and harps. <verse number="28" style="v" />You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-bye. That was a foolish thing to do! <verse number="29" style="v" />I have the power to do you harm, but last night the God of your father warned me not to threaten you in any way. <verse number="30" style="v" />I know that you left because you were so anxious to get back home, but why did you steal my household gods?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />Jacob answered, “I was afraid, because I thought that you might take your daughters away from me. <verse number="32" style="v" />But if you find that anyone here has your gods, he will be put to death. Here, with our men as witnesses, look for anything that belongs to you and take what is yours.” Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban's gods.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="33" style="v" />Laban went and searched Jacob's tent; then he went into Leah's tent, and the tent of the two slave women, but he did not find his gods. Then he went into Rachel's tent. <verse number="34" style="v" />Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in a camel's saddlebag and was sitting on them. Laban searched through the whole tent, but did not find them. <verse number="35" style="v" />Rachel said to her father, “Do not be angry with me, sir, but I am not able to stand up in your presence; I am having my monthly period.” Laban searched but did not find his household gods.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="36" style="v" />Then Jacob lost his temper. “What crime have I committed?” he asked angrily. “What law have I broken that gives you the right to hunt me down? <verse number="37" style="v" />Now that you have searched through all my belongings, what household article have you found that belongs to you? Put it out here where your men and mine can see it, and let them decide which one of us is right. <verse number="38" style="v" />I have been with you now for twenty years; your sheep and your goats have not failed to reproduce, and I have not eaten any rams from your flocks. <verse number="39" style="v" />Whenever a sheep was killed by wild animals, I always bore the loss myself. I didn't take it to you to show that it was not my fault. You demanded that I make good anything that was stolen during the day or during the night. <verse number="40" style="v" />Many times I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was not able to sleep. <verse number="41" style="v" />It was like that for the whole twenty years I was with you. For fourteen years I worked to win your two daughters—and six years for your flocks. And even then, you changed my wages ten times. <verse number="42" style="v" />If the God of my fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac, had not been with me, you would have already sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my trouble and the work I have done, and last night he gave his judgment.”</para>
  <para style="s">The Agreement between Jacob and Laban</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="43" style="v" />Laban answered Jacob, “These young women are my daughters; their children belong to me, and these flocks are mine. In fact, everything you see here belongs to me.

Let us make a pile of stones to remind us of our agreement.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="45" style="v" />So Jacob got a stone and set it up as a memorial. <verse number="46" style="v" />He told his men to gather some rocks and pile them up.

After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. <verse number="55" style="v" />Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters good-bye, and left to go back home.</para>
