    <char style="bk">The Gospel according to Luke</char> presents Jesus as both the promised Savior of Israel and as the Savior of all people. <char style="bk">Luke</char> records that Jesus was called by the Spirit of the Lord to “bring good news to the poor,” and this Gospel is filled with a concern for people with all kinds of need. The note of joy is also prominent in <char style="bk">Luke</char>, especially in the opening chapters that announce the coming of Jesus, and again at the conclusion, when Jesus ascends to heaven. The story of the growth and spread of the Christian faith after the ascension of Jesus is told by the same writer in the book of <char style="bk">Acts</char>.</para>
  <para style="ip">Parts 2 and 6 (see the outline below) contain much material that is found only in this Gospel, such as the stories about the song of the angels and the shepherds' visit at the birth of Jesus, Jesus in the Temple as a boy, and the parables of the Good Samaritan and the Lost Son. Throughout the Gospel great emphasis is placed on prayer, the Holy Spirit, the role of women in the ministry of Jesus, and God's forgiveness of sins.</para>
