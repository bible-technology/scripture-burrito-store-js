    <char style="bk">The Gospel according to John</char> presents Jesus as the eternal Word of God, who “became a human being and lived among us.” As the book itself says, this Gospel was written so that its readers might believe that Jesus is the promised Savior, the Son of God, and that through their faith in him they may have life (20.31).</para>
  <para style="ip">After an introduction that identifies the eternal Word of God with Jesus, the first part of the Gospel presents various miracles which show that Jesus is the promised Savior, the Son of God. These are followed by discourses that explain what is revealed by the miracles. This part of the book tells how some people believed in Jesus and became his followers, while others opposed him and refused to believe. Chapters 13—17 record at length the close fellowship of Jesus with his disciples on the night of his arrest, and his words of preparation and encouragement to them on the eve of his crucifixion. The closing chapters tell of Jesus' arrest and trial, his crucifixion and resurrection, and his appearances to his disciples after the resurrection.</para>
  <para style="ip">The story of the woman caught in adultery (8.1-11) is placed in brackets because many manuscripts and early translations omit it, while others include it in other places.</para>
  <para style="ip">
    <char style="bk">John</char> emphasizes the gift of eternal life through Christ, a gift which begins now and which comes to those who respond to Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life. A striking feature of <char style="bk">John</char> is the symbolic use of common things from everyday life to point to spiritual realities, such as water, bread, light, the shepherd and his sheep, and the grapevine and its fruit.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />In the beginning the Word already existed; the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <verse number="2" style="v" />From the very beginning the Word was with God. <verse number="3" style="v" />Through him God made all things; not one thing in all creation was made without him. <verse number="4" style="v" />The Word was the source of life, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.4: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">The Word was the source of life; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">What was made had life in union with the Word.</char></note> and this life brought light to people. <verse number="5" style="v" />The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has never put it out.</para>

    </note> God sent his messenger, a man named John, <verse number="7" style="v" />who came to tell people about the light, so that all should hear the message and believe. <verse number="8" style="v" />He himself was not the light; he came to tell about the light. <verse number="9" style="v" />This was the real light—the light that comes into the world and shines on all people.</para>

    <verse number="10" style="v" />The Word was in the world, and though God made the world through him, yet the world did not recognize him. <verse number="11" style="v" />He came to his own country, but his own people did not receive him. <verse number="12" style="v" />Some, however, did receive him and believed in him; so he gave them the right to become God's children. <verse number="13" style="v" />They did not become God's children by natural means, that is, by being born as the children of a human father; God himself was their Father.</para>

    <verse number="16" style="v" />Out of the fullness of his grace he has blessed us all, giving us one blessing after another. <verse number="17" style="v" />God gave the Law through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <verse number="18" style="v" />No one has ever seen God.

    </note> Peter turned around and saw behind him that other disciple, whom Jesus loved—the one who had leaned close to Jesus at the meal and had asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?” <verse number="21" style="v" />When Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”</para>

    <verse number="22" style="v" />Jesus answered him, “If I want him to live until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!”</para>
  <para style="p">

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />He is the disciple who spoke of these things, the one who also wrote them down; and we know that what he said is true.</para>

    <verse number="25" style="v" />Now, there are many other things that Jesus did. If they were all written down one by one, I suppose that the whole world could not hold the books that would be written.</para>
