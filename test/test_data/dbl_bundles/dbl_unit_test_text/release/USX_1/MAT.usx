    <char style="bk">The Gospel according to Matthew</char> tells the good news that Jesus is the promised Savior, the one through whom God fulfilled the promises he made to his people in the Old Testament. This good news is not only for the Jewish people, among whom Jesus was born and lived, but for the whole world.</para>
  <para style="ip">
    <char style="bk">Matthew</char> is carefully arranged. It begins with the birth of Jesus, describes his baptism and temptation, and then takes up his ministry of preaching, teaching, and healing in Galilee. After this the Gospel records Jesus' journey from Galilee to Jerusalem and the events of Jesus' last week, culminating in his crucifixion and resurrection.</para>
  <para style="ip">This Gospel presents Jesus as the great Teacher, who has the authority to interpret the Law of God, and who teaches about the Kingdom of God. Much of his teaching is gathered by subject matter into five collections: (1) the Sermon on the Mount, which concerns the character, duties, privileges, and destiny of the citizens of the Kingdom of heaven (chapters 5–7); (2) instructions to the twelve disciples for their mission (chapter 10); (3) parables about the Kingdom of heaven (chapter 13); (4) teaching on the meaning of discipleship (chapter 18); and (5) teaching about the end of the present age and the coming of the Kingdom of God (chapters 24–25).</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judea, during the time when Herod was king. Soon afterward, some men who studied the stars came from the East to Jerusalem <verse number="2" style="v" />and asked, “Where is the baby born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star when it came up in the east, and we have come to worship him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />When King Herod heard about this, he was very upset, and so was everyone else in Jerusalem. <verse number="4" style="v" />He called together all the chief priests and the teachers of the Law and asked them, “Where will the Messiah be born?”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />So Herod called the visitors from the East to a secret meeting and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. <verse number="8" style="v" />Then he sent them to Bethlehem with these instructions: “Go and make a careful search for the child; and when you find him, let me know, so that I too may go and worship him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9-10" style="v" />And so they left, and on their way they saw the same star they had seen in the East. When they saw it, how happy they were, what joy was theirs! It went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. <verse number="11" style="v" />They went into the house, and when they saw the child with his mother Mary, they knelt down and worshiped him. They brought out their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and presented them to him.</para>
